# Mock Asset Gallery

This folder contains example HTML showcasing pastel-themed feature cards for Ay & At Boutique. Each card uses subtle 3D effects, soft shadows and simple inline SVG to represent clothing categories:

- Infant romper with sample branding
- Toddler dress (includes an `Embroidery` label to illustrate customization)
- Children's apparel set
- Adult hoodie

The file `index.html` is standalone. Open it in a browser to view the mock cards. These assets are intended as placeholders for further design work and can be replaced with highâ€‘resolution product images when available.
